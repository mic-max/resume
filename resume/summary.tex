\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

Current Senior at Carleton with an expected graduation date in April 2019. 5+ years of programming experience, with a focus in backend development and software engineering. In between schoolwork I like attending hackathons and exploring hobbyist electronics. I'm very interested in parallel \& distributed computing where performance metrics are critical. Seeking job opportunities in North America for a role I can mature into and become an effective addition to the team.
